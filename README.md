# My Password Generator, in application form!

## This is much more accessible and user friendly rather than a previous version that relied on using VSCode and dotNET to run the program. Now it's an executable that can be used


# As a previous and private version said, DO NOT SAVE ANY PASSWORDS LOCALLY. KEEP THEM SECURE


# HOW TO USE

## 1. Open the [compressed file](https://github.com/NovaFlash321/PasswordGeneratorApplication/blob/master/Password%20Generator/bin/Release/PasswordGen.zip) 

## 2. Unzip into specified folder

## 3. As there is no need to save .txt files from previous version, choose the length of desired password (10-25 characters)
